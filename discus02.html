          <h1>Explore<br />Discus Throw</h1>
          <p>
            The discus throw is a track and field event where athletes spin within a circle to launch a heavy disc as far as possible. 
          Success relies on mastering the spinning technique and optimal release angle. It combines strength, precision, and technique to achieve maximum distance.

        <h5>WHAT IS DISCUS THROW?</h5>
        <p>
          The discus throw is a track and field event in which athletes aim to throw a heavy, circular disc, known as a discus, as far as possible. Competitors begin by spinning within a 2.5-meter diameter circle to build momentum, then release the discus at an optimal angle to maximize distance. 
                  The throw is measured from the circle’s inner edge to the point where the discus first lands, and athletes must stay within the circle throughout the throw. The event combines physical strength, precision, and refined technique, requiring both explosive power and skillful execution to achieve impressive distances.

        <h5>EQUIPMENT USED</h5>
        <p>
          <p><b>Discus:</b>A circular, weighted disc typically made of metal or a composite material. It weighs 2 kg (4.4 lbs) for men and 1 kg (2.2 lbs) for women, with a diameter of 22 cm (8.6 inches) for men and 18 cm (7.1 inches) for women.

            <b>Throwing Circle:</b>A 2.5-meter (8.2-foot) diameter circle, made of metal or a durable surface, from which the throw is executed. The circle is marked with a thin metal or painted line.
            
            <b>Sector:</b>The area within which the discus must land to be considered a valid throw. The sector extends from the circle and is usually marked by lines or boundaries on the field.
            
            <b>Gloves (Optional):</b>Some athletes wear gloves for a better grip on the discus, though this is not always required.

        <h5>DISCUS THROW GROUND</h5>
        <p>
          The discus throw ground, or competition area, is crucial for the event's execution and measurement. It includes a 2.5-meter diameter throwing circle from which athletes perform their throw.
                 Surrounding this circle is a sector marked by two lines that extend outward and converge to form an angle of 34.92 degrees, defining the area where the discus must land to count as a valid throw.
                  The landing area within this sector is kept clear of obstacles and is where the discus's distance from the circle's edge is measured. Accurate measurement is typically done using a tape measure, ensuring fair competition and precise results.

        <h5>HOW TO THROW DISCUS?</h5>
        <p>
          To throw a discus effectively, begin by gripping the discus with your fingers spread across the back and your thumb and index finger supporting the rim. Stand in the throwing circle with feet shoulder-width apart, facing away from the sector.
             Start by positioning the discus at shoulder height, bending your elbow, and shifting your weight onto your back foot. As you wind up, rotate your torso and hips, moving the discus behind you. Initiate a controlled spin within the circle, using your hips and shoulders to generate momentum while keeping balanced.
              Release the discus with a flick of your wrist at an angle of about 35-40 degrees, ensuring it spins for maximum distance. Finally, follow through smoothly and avoid stepping outside the circle before the discus lands to prevent a foul throw. Mastery of these steps requires practice to perfect timing and technique for optimal performance.

      <div class="content-text">
        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
          In discus throw, points are scored based on the distance the discus travels within the sector lines. Each athlete is given a set number of attempts, typically six, and only the longest valid throw counts towards their final score.
             A throw is considered valid if it lands within the sector, which is defined by two lines extending from the throwing circle. The distance is measured from the inside edge of the circle to the point where the discus first touches the ground.
              Throws are disqualified if the discus lands outside the sector or if the athlete steps outside the circle before the discus lands. The athlete with the longest valid throw is ranked highest and wins the event.
