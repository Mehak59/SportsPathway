        <h5>HOW TO PLAY WRESTLING?</h5>
            <p>
                A typical freestyle wrestling bout, much like Greco-Roman, is divided into two periods of 
                three minutes each with a 30-second break in between.<br><br>
                Two competing wrestlers face each other on a mat, nine-metre in diameter, 
                with the primary objective of pinning the opponent's shoulders to the mat for a short 
                duration of time, that hands the wrestler an instant victory by 'fall'.<br><br>
                In modern-day wrestling, however, particularly big events like the Olympics and the World 
                Championships, victory by fall is a rarity. There are, however, several other ways to win a bout.<br><br>
                The most common, perhaps, is victory by points. Wrestlers can try and score points by executing 
                legal holds, throws, takedowns, manoeuvring the opponent to expose his back to the mat for several 
                seconds or by executing reversals.<br><br>
