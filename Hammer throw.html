          <h1>Explore<br />Hammer Throw</h1>
          <p>
            The hammer throw is an athletic event that involves throwing a heavy metal ball attached to a wire 
            handle. The athlete swings the hammer in a circular motion around their head and body, building up momentum 
            before releasing it. The goal is to throw the hammer as far as possible. The hammer throw is a complex and 
            physically demanding event that requires strength, power, coordination, and technique. It is a popular event in 
            track and field competitions around the world.

          <h5>WHAT IS HAMMER THROW?</h5>
          <p>
            The hammer throw is one of the four throwing events in regular outdoor track and field competitions, 
            along with the discus throw, shot put and javelin.<br>
            The "hammer" used in this sport is not like any of the tools also called by that name. It consists 
            of a metal ball attached by a steel wire to a grip. These three components are each separate and 
            can move independently. Both the size and weight of the ball vary between men's and women's events.

        <h5>HAMMER THROW FIELD</h5>
        <p>
          <b>Throwing Circle: </b>diameter of approximately 2.5 meters (8.2 feet).
          <br><br>
          <b>Sector: </b>The hammer must land within a designated sector, which is a 
          34.92-degree (or approximately 63.5Â°) arc centered on the throwing circle.
          <br><br>
          <b>Landing Surface: </b>The sector is typically marked on a grass or dirt surface.

        <h5>HOW TO HAMMER THROW?</h5>
          <p>
            <b>Priliminary Swinging: </b>Use two swinging motions to generate momentum. The swinging must start 
            from behind the right side of your body, taking the hammer in the forward direction away from your 
            body. The low point of the hammer will be in a 12 o'clock position, and the tip will be in a 6 o'clock 
            position with respect to your body.
            <br><br>
            <b>Turning Phase: </b>After the swinging, enter the turning phase. The hammer will come directly 
            in front of you, and you'll start rotating the low point. Through repetitive rotation, the ball will 
            achieve acceleration, while you keep rotating with your feet in contact with the circle.
            <br><br>
            <b>Release: </b>Release the hammer at the high point, opposite the low point. This is typically around 
            the 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock position.
            <br><br>
            <b>Follow Through: </b>Complete the remaining turns (3 o'clock to 12 o'clock) using the ball of your foot. 
            Shift your left foot to the heel level as the hammer approaches the 12 o'clock position, and initiate the next turn.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
          <p>
            <b>Measurement: </b>The distance a hammer is thrown is measured by a judge or multiple judges upon 
            a successful attempt. This distance is then recorded as a score.
            <br><br>
            <b>Ranking: </b>Athletes are ranked according to their best throw, with the farthest throw 
            receiving the highest ranking.
            <br><br>
            <b>Competition Format: </b>In most competitions, including the Olympics, athletes have six total 
            attempts to achieve their best throw. The athlete with the furthest distance after six attempts 
            is crowned the winner.

        <h5>SCORING SYSTEM</h5>
          <p>
            The scoring system in hammer throw is based on the distance the hammer travels. The athlete who throws the hammer the 
            farthest distance wins the competition.
            <br><br>
            <b>Ranking: </b>The athletes are ranked based on the distance of their best throw.
            <br><br>
            <b>Ties: </b>If two or more athletes have the same best throw, a tiebreaker is used. This can include re-throws or other 
            criteria determined by the competition rules.
