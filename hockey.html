        <h5>HOCKEY FIELD/ICE RINK</h5>
        <p>
          A hockey field or ice rink is a rectangular playing surface where the game is played. In field hockey, the field is typically 100 yards long and 60 yards wide, marked with lines indicating various areas such as the shooting circle. Ice hockey is played on a rink measuring 200 feet long and 85 feet wide, with specific zones for offense, defense, and goaltending.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY HOCKEY?</h5>
        <p>
          In hockey, teams aim to score goals by hitting the ball or puck into the opponent's net. Players work together to pass, dribble, and shoot while adhering to game rules. The game starts with a face-off or pushback, depending on the variation, and players must stay within their designated positions to maintain team strategy.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
          In hockey, points are scored when a player successfully hits the ball or puck into the opponent's goal. In field hockey, goals can only be scored from within the shooting circle. In ice hockey, teams can score from anywhere in the offensive zone, and the puck must fully cross the goal line for a point to be awarded.

        <h5>SERVING IN HOCKEY</h5>
        <p>
          In field hockey, the game starts with a pushback, where the ball is passed from the center of the field. In ice hockey, the game begins with a face-off, where the referee drops the puck between players from opposing teams. Both variations require precise timing and strategy to gain control of the ball or puck early in the game.
