          <p>
            Boxing is a combat sport where two athletes, wearing gloves, fight each other in a ring using punches. The objective is to score points by landing clean, effective punches or to win by knockout, which occurs when an opponent is rendered unable to continue. Matches are divided into rounds, typically lasting three minutes each, with a short break in between. 
            Scoring is done by judges who assess the effectiveness and accuracy of punches, defensive skills, and overall control of the bout. Boxing requires skill, strategy, and physical conditioning, and it is governed by various rules to ensure safety and fairness.

        <h5>WHAT IS BOXING?</h5>
        <p>
          Boxing is a competitive combat sport where two participants, wearing protective gloves, face off in a ring and attempt to outscore or defeat each other through punching. The aim is to land accurate, powerful punches while avoiding and defending against the opponent’s strikes.
                   The sport is structured into rounds, each typically lasting three minutes with a one-minute break in between. Matches are judged based on the number and quality of punches landed, as well as overall control and strategy. Victory can be achieved through a knockout, where an opponent is unable to continue, or by accumulating more points than the opponent by the end of the match.
                    Boxing requires a combination of physical conditioning, tactical skill, and strategic thinking.

        <h5>BOXING RING</h5>
        <p>
          The boxing ring is a crucial element of the sport, designed to provide a safe and regulated environment for matches. Typically square or rectangular, the ring measures between 16 to 20 feet on each side, depending on the level of competition.
                 It is enclosed by four ropes, which are padded and set at different heights to keep fighters within the ring and offer some protection from falls. The floor of the ring is padded with layers of cushioning and covered with a canvas material to absorb impact and minimize injury.
                  Each corner of the ring features padded corner posts to safeguard fighters during matches and provide a space for their corner teams to assist them between rounds. The ring’s layout ensures that all bouts are conducted fairly and safely, allowing athletes to perform at their best while adhering to the sport's regulations.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY BOXING?</h5>
        <p>
          To participate in boxing, start by learning the fundamental techniques and rules of the sport. First, familiarize yourself with the basic stance, which involves standing with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hands up to protect your face. Practice essential punches such as the jab, cross, hook, and uppercut, ensuring proper form and technique to maximize effectiveness and minimize injury. 
            Focus on defensive skills, including blocking, slipping, and weaving to avoid incoming punches.Training typically involves working with a coach, using punching bags, and sparring with partners to develop skills and endurance. Matches are fought in rounds, with points awarded based on the effectiveness and accuracy of punches, as well as overall control of the bout. Victory can be achieved by scoring more points than your opponent or by knocking them out.
             Consistent practice, strategy, and physical conditioning are crucial for success in boxing.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
          In boxing, points are scored based on the effectiveness of punches and overall control of the bout. Judges evaluate each fighter’s performance round by round, awarding points for clean, powerful punches that land on target areas like the head and torso. The 10-point must system is commonly used, where the winner of each round receives 10 points and the opponent gets 9 or fewer, depending on their performance. 
          Effective defense, such as blocking and countering, and ring control also contribute to scoring. Knockdowns, where a fighter is knocked to the canvas but recovers, can lead to a 10-8 round for the fighter who caused the knockdown. A knockout (KO), which ends the fight, results in the attacking fighter being declared the winner.
           At the end of the match, the total points from all rounds are tallied to determine the winner, unless the fight is ended early by a knockout.
