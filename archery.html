        <h5>WHAT IS ARCHERY?</h5>
        <p>
            Archery is a sport where players use a bow to shoot arrows at a target. The objective 
            is to score points by hitting the target's central area, known as the "bullseye." Archery 
            requires precision, control, and focus, with participants aiming from varying distances 
            depending on the event. It includes different forms such as target archery, field archery, 
            and bowhunting. Historically significant and practiced in various cultures, archery is 
            also a popular competitive sport, featured in the Olympics and numerous international 
            tournaments.

        <h5>ARCHERY GROUND</h5>
        <p>
            An archery ground is a designated area for practicing and competing in archery. It typically 
            features a target range with targets set at various distances, shooting lanes for archers, 
            and safety zones to protect spectators and non-participants. A scoreboard is often present to 
            display scores and distances. These grounds are designed to provide a safe and organized 
            environment for archers to practice and compete.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY ARCHERY?</h5>
        <p>
            To play archery, set up your bow, arrows, and target. Stand with your feet shoulder-width 
            apart and nock an arrow onto the bowstring. Draw the bowstring back, aim at the target, and 
            release the string smoothly to shoot the arrow. After shooting, check the target to see where 
            your arrow landed and score based on its proximity to the center. 
            Practicing these steps helps develop precision and control in archery.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
            In archery, points are scored based on where the arrow lands on the target. The target 
            is divided into concentric rings, with the innermost ring, or bullseye, scoring the highest 
            points. Each ring outside the bullseye is worth progressively fewer points. When an arrow 
            lands within a specific ring, the score for that ring is awarded. If an arrow lands on the 
            line between two rings, the higher score is given. 
            Accurate aiming and consistent shooting are key to maximizing points.

        <h5>TARGET IN ARCHERY</h5>
        <p>
            In archery, the target is a circular board with concentric rings, each representing 
            different point values. The center ring, or bullseye, scores the highest points, while 
            the outer rings decrease in value as they move outward. The target is usually placed at a 
            set distance from the archer and can be made from materials like straw, foam, or other 
            specialized substances. Accurate shots into the bullseye or inner rings yield higher scores, 
            making the target a crucial element for scoring and competition in archery.
