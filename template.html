        <h5>WHAT IS BADMINTON?</h5>
        <p>
          Badminton is one of the most popular sports in the world, with a
            passionate fan following around the globe. It is also one of the
            biggest draws at multi-sport spectacles like the Olympics. A regular
            fixture since the Barcelona 1992 Olympics, badminton now has five
            disciplines at the Games after mixed doubles was introduced at
            Atlanta 1996. While badminton is most popular in Asia, it also
            attracts great interest in Europe with players from Denmark among
            those regularly challenging for top honours.

        <h5>EQUIPMENT USED</h5>
        <p>
          <b>Racket: </b>A lightweight racket made of materials like carbon
          fiber or aluminum, designed for speed and control.<br />
          <b>Shuttlecock: </b>It has a rounded cork base, which is often
          covered with thin leather, and is topped with a skirt made of 16
          overlapping feathers. The unique design allows it to be
          aerodynamically stable, ensuring it flies smoothly through the air
          while rapidly decelerating. Shuttlecocks are lightweight, usually
          weighing between 4.74 to 5.50 grams.

        <h5>BADMINTON COURT</h5>
        <p>
          Badminton Courts are the rectangular surfaces used for the racket
          sport of badminton. Courts are usually marked for both singles or
          doubles games with boundary widths varying between the two match
          types. Badminton courts are surfaced with safe flooring materials
          for gameplay. Badminton Courts have a length of 44’ (13.4 m), but
          double courts are 20’ (6.1 m) wide while single courts are reduced
          to 17’ (5.18 m); shrinking by 1.5’ (.46 m) on both sides. Service
          courts are split by a center line dividing the width of the court
          and are set back from the net by a ‘short service line’ of 6.5’.
          Doubles games also require a ‘long service line. Clearances of 2’
          (.61 m) should be providing around the entire badminton court.
