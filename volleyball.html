          <h1>Explore<br />Volleyball</h1>
          <p>
            Volleyball is a team sport played on a rectangular court, divided by a net. The objective is to score points by 
            grounding the ball on the opponent's side of the court. Players use their hands to pass, set, and spike the ball. 
            The game requires a combination of athleticism, coordination, and strategy. It is known for its fast-paced 
            nature, exciting rallies, and the ability to be played both indoors and outdoors.

          <h5>WHAT IS VOLLEYBALL?</h5>
          <p>
            Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. 
            Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.<br>
            A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking 
            (because those plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill 
            emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions. 
            Offensive and defensive structures are also key plays.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL?</h5>
            <p>
                <b>Serve: </b>A game starts with a serve, where one player from Team A serves the ball by hitting 
                it over the net to Team B's court.<br><br>
                <b>Rally: </b>The ball is then hit back and forth between the two teams until one team fails 
                to return it or makes an error.<br><br>
                <b>Scoring: </b>A team scores a point when the opponent fails to return the ball or makes an error, 
                such as hitting the ball out of bounds or into the net.<br><br>
                <b>Sets: </b>A match is typically played best three out of five or best four out of seven sets.<br><br>
                <b>Roation: </b>After each serve, the teams rotate one position clockwise, ensuring each player plays in every position.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
          <p>
            <b>Rally Scoring: </b>Rally scoring is when a team gets a point when the other team fails to return the 
            ball over the net,  or when the ball goes out of bounds, commits an infraction or makes a service error.
            <br><br>
            <b>Sideout Scoring: </b>When the opposing team fails to return the ball over the net, hit the ball 
            out of bounds, commits an infraction or make a service error, the serving team scores a point. 
            This also counts for the receiving team.
            <br><br>
            Games are played until a team hits 25 points and at least has a two point lead to win the set. 
            Most games has five sets, so to win a team must have won three out of five sets.

        <h5>INDIANS IN VOLLEYBALL</h5>
          <p>
            Though it was informally played for a long time, the first interstate volleyball championships were held 
            by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) in 1936 in pre-independent India.
            <br><br>
            The Indian volleyball team had an almost immediate impact on the global stage, winning the 1955 
            Asian Tournament in Tokyo and another followed soon, at the 1958 Asian Games.
            <br><br>
            The general popularity of volleyball in India declined in the years to follow as in-fighting 
            within federations. Adding to it was the rise of the Indian cricket team as a powerhouse.
            The Indian volleyball men and women's teams dominated the South Asian Federation Games in the 
            nineties, winning three medals each, but it did not spark a revival, with underpar performances 
            to follow at the 2002 and 2006 Asian Games by the men.
