        <h5>SWIMMING POOL</h5>
        <p>
          At the international level, swimming pools are meticulously designed to meet stringent standards for major competitions like the Olympics and World Championships.
               These pools are typically 50 meters in length and 25 meters in width, with a minimum depth of 2 meters to ensure a consistent and fair environment for all swimmers. 
                 They are equipped with 10 lanes, including the central eight used for competition, and feature high-quality starting blocks for optimal performance during races. 
                 The water is maintained at precise temperatures (around 25-28°C or 77-82°F) and balanced chemically to ensure safety and comfort. Electronic touchpads at each end of the pool accurately record race times, while clearly marked lanes and turn indicators help swimmers navigate the course.

        <h5>HOW TO SWIM?</h5>
        <p>
          To engage in swimming, start by mastering basic strokes such as freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Begin with learning the techniques for each stroke, including proper arm movements, kicking, and breathing patterns. For freestyle, practice alternating your breathing while keeping your head aligned with your body. 
            Focus on refining your technique to reduce drag and improve efficiency in the water. Equip yourself with essentials like swim goggles and a well-fitting swimsuit. Gradually build your endurance by increasing the distance and intensity of your swims, incorporating varied strokes and interval training. 
            Always prioritize safety by swimming in supervised areas and adhering to pool regulations. With consistent practice and proper technique, swimming becomes an enjoyable and effective way to stay fit and healthy.

      <div class="content-text">
        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
          In competitive swimming, points are not directly scored; instead, swimmers compete against the clock and each other to achieve the fastest times. Races are typically held in various distances and strokes, and swimmers are ranked based on their finishing times. The swimmer with the fastest time in a race is declared the winner.
          In team-based events like relay races, the combined times of team members determine the final placement. Additionally, many swimming competitions, such as the Olympics or World Championships, award medals (gold, silver, bronze) to the top three finishers in each event. In some leagues or series, overall performance points might be accumulated across multiple events to determine overall rankings or champions.
