          <h1>Explore<br />Squash</h1>
          <p>
            Squash is a fast-paced racquet sport played either one-on-one (singles) or with two teams of 
            two players each (doubles). It’s played on a four-walled court, and the objective is to hit a 
            small 
            rubber ball against the front wall in such a way that the opponent cannot return it before it 
            bounces twice.

        <h5>EQUIPMENT USED</h5>
        <p><b>Racket: </b>Squash racquets are lightweight, typically weighing between 110 to 160 grams, and have a small, oval-shaped head. 
            They are designed to provide control and power while being easy to maneuver.<br>
            <b>Ball:</b>The squash ball is small, rubber, and comes in various types that differ in bounce and speed. The most common balls are color-coded (e.g., yellow for extra-duty, 
            red for standard) to indicate their level of bounce and suitability for different court surfaces.</p>

        <h5>SQUASH COURT</h5>
              <p>A squash court is a four-walled space, measuring 9.75 meters long and 6.4 meters wide. It 
                features a front wall with an 
                "outline" at the top and a "tin" at the bottom. The side and back walls are also in play. The 
                court includes service boxes where the server stands, and various lines that define play areas. 
                Courts are often constructed from wood or glass, with glass walls popular in professional settings 
                for viewing purposes.
                The floor is marked with a short line that divides the court into two halves. The front wall's upper 
                boundary ensures the ball stays within the play area. The walls are typically painted white or have 
                a reflective surface to improve visibility. The court's dimensions and markings are standardized to ensure consistent play across different locations.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY SQUASH?</h5>
          <p>To play squash, hit the ball against the front wall so your opponent can’t return it before it bounces twice. 
            Serve from one of the service boxes, making sure the ball hits above the service line and lands in the opposite box. During rallies, the ball must hit the front wall before bouncing on the floor. Points are scored when your opponent fails to return the ball or hits it out of bounds. 
            The game requires quick reflexes and strategic positioning.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
          <p>In squash, points are scored based on several key factors. You earn a point if your opponent fails to return the 
            ball before it bounces twice on the floor. The ball must be hit before it bounces twice, so if your opponent misses or 
            lets it bounce twice, you win the point. Additionally, points are awarded if the opponent's shot goes out of bounds; the ball 
            must strike the front wall between the top boundary (outline) and the bottom boundary (tin). 
            If the ball hits above the outline or below the tin, it’s out of play, and you score a point.</p>

        <h5>HOW TO WIN IN SQUASH?</h5>
          <p>To win in squash, score more points than your opponent by successfully hitting the ball against 
            the front wall so they cannot return it before it bounces twice. Points are earned when your 
            opponent fails to make a valid return, hits the ball out of bounds, or obstructs your play. 
            Matches are typically played to 11 or 9 points, and the player who first reaches the required 
            number of points wins the 
            game. Matches are often played as the best of three or five games.
