          <h5>WHAT IS BASKETBALL?</h5>
          <p>
            Basketball is a team sport where two teams, each typically consisting of five players, compete on a rectangular court. 
            The main objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop, which is an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket. 
            It was invented by James Naismith on or about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Training School, 
            Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education. 
            Basketball is the only major sport strictly of U.S. origin (although Naismith was born in Canada).

        <h5>EQUIPMENT USED</h5>
        <p>
          <b>Ball: </b>The centerpiece of the game is, of course, the basketball. 
          According to Internatinal Basketball Federation (FIBA) the ball size for men's games is SIZE 7 (29.5 inches) and for women's games is SIZE 6 (28.5 inches).
          <br><br>
          <b>Basketball hoop and Backboard: </b>No game can be played without a hoop. 
          A standard basketball hoop is mounted to a backboard and stands 10 feet off the ground. he hoop includes a rim, 
          typically made of steel, and a net, which helps us see clearly when the ball goes through.
          <br><br>
          <b>Basketball Court:</b> The game unfolds on a basketball court, a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends. 
          A standard court is made of polished wood, but outdoor courts might be made of concrete or asphalt.
          <br><br>
          <b>Basketball Shoes: </b>Basketball shoes are one of the most essential pieces of equipment to play the sport. 
          ALthough basketball can be playes in regular sneakers, a good pair of shoes will give you an edge on the court while providing
          extra safety.

            <ul>
              <li>
                  Each team can have a maximum of 5 players on the court at any one time. 
                  Substitutions can be made as many times as they wish within the game.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  The ball can only be moved by either dribbling (bouncing the ball) or passing the ball. 
                  Once a player puts two hands on the ball (not including catching the ball) they cannot then dribble or 
                  move with the ball and the ball must be passed or shot.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  After the ball goes into a team's half and they win possession back the ball must then make it back over
                  the half way line within 10 seconds. 
                  The ball fails to do so then a foul will be called and the ball will be turned over.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  After each successful basket the ball is then turned over to the opposition.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  Fouls committed throughout the game will be accumulated and then when reached a certain number will be eventually be awarded as a free throw. 
                  A free throw involves one playerfrom the offensive team (the player fouled) to take a shot unopposed from the free throw line. 
                  Depending on where the foul was committed will depend on the number free throws a player gets.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  Violations in basketball include travelling (taking more than one step without bouncing the ball), double dribble (picking the ball up dribbling, 
                  stopping then dribbling again with two hands), goaltending (a defensive player interferes with the ball travelling downwards towards the basket) 
                  and back court violation (once the ball passes the half way line the offensive team cannot take the ball back over the half way line).

        <h5>INDIANS IN BASKETBALL</h5>
          <p>
            Basketball was introduced to India in the late 19th centur,

            <br>
            There are many championships for senior, junior, and youth levels for boys and girls.
            Invitational all-India tournaments like Master Prithvinath Memorial, Don Bosco Invitational Tournament, 
            Kiloi Invitational Tournament, Ramu Memorial and many other are being organised every year.
            <br>
