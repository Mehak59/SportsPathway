          <h1>Explore<br />Roller Speed Skating</h1>
          <p>
            Roller speed skating is a high-energy sport that requires exceptional balance, agility, and endurance. 
            Skaters wear specially designed roller skates with hard wheels and compete on a track, often indoors. 
            The objective is to complete laps around the track as quickly as possible, with the fastest skater claiming 
            victory. The sport is known for its fast-paced nature and the exhilarating feeling of gliding around the 
            track at high speeds.

          <h5>WHAT IS ROLLER SPEED SKATING?</h5>
          <p>
            Roller speed skating is a roller sport that involves racing on inline skates, typically on outdoor or 
            indoor tracks with banked walls or closed road circuits. Skaters wear specialized inline skates with 
            a maximum of five wheels, each with a diameter not exceeding 110mm.<br><br>
            Roller speed skating offers both recreational and competitive opportunities. 
            Recreational skaters can enjoy the sport for fitness and fun, while competitive athletes 
            can participate in organized events and tournaments, striving for excellence and recognition.

        <h5>ROLLER SPEED SKATING RINK</h5>
        <p>
            A standard long track speed skating track is, according to the regulations of the International Skating Union (ISU), 
            a double-laned track with two curved ends each of 180°, in which the radius of the inner curve is not less 
            than 25 metres and not more than 26 metres. The width of the competition lanes is 4 metres. At the opposite 
            straight of the finishing line, there is a crossing area, where the skaters must change lane.
            <br><br>
            At international competitions, the track must be 400 metres long, with a warm-up lane at least 4 metres 
            wide inside the competition lanes. For Olympic competitions, the track must also be enclosed within a building.

        <h5>HOW TO DO ROLLER SPEED SKATING?</h5>
          <p>
            Place your feet shoulder width apart, bend your knees, and squat. Lower your backside toward the 
            ground and lean slightly forward in a comfortable squatting position. When you're roller skating, 
            balance is key, and this stance will prevent you from toppling over.
            <br><br>
            With your heels together and your toes pointed out, begin slowly walking forward, first the right, 
            then to the left, then to the right, and so on.
            <br><br>
            Lengthen each stride you take by allowing yourself to roll for awhile. Push off with one foot and 
            glide with the other until you lose momentum, then switch your gliding foot.
            <br><br>
            The best way to get better at roller skating is to practice often. Find a roller skating rink 
            in your area and go there at least once a week so that you'll be able to build on your skills each time you go.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
          <p>
            In roller speed skating, points are awarded to athletes based on their finish positions in each event. 
            The scoring system is as follows:<br>
            <b>•</b>The winner of each race receives 14 points.<br>
            <b>•</b>Each subsequent finisher earns one less point, down to 1 point for the 14th place.
            <br><br>
            The final rankings are determined by the total number of points accumulated by each skater across the three required events:
            <br>
            <b>1. </b>500 m<br>
            <b>2. </b>1000 m<br>
            <b>3. </b>5000 m elimination<br>
            <br>
            The skater with the highest total point score at the end of the three events is declared the winner.
