          <h1>Explore<br />Javelin Throw</h1>
          <p>
            The javelin throw is a track and field event where athletes throw a long, slender spear called a javelin as far as possible. Competitors sprint within a designated area before launching the javelin overhand, aiming for maximum distance. 
            The throw is measured from the point where the javelin first touches the ground. Success in the javelin throw relies on a combination of speed, technique, and strength. It is a key event in athletics, showcasing both precision and power.

        <h5>WHAT IS JAVELIN THROW?</h5>
        <p>
          The javelin throw is a track and field event where athletes compete to throw a spear-like object, called a javelin, as far as possible. The javelin, traditionally made of metal or composite materials, is about 2.5 meters long and weighs between 600 to 800 grams.<br>

          In the event, competitors run within a designated area, called the "throwing sector," and release the javelin overhand, using a technique that combines speed, strength, and precision. The throw is measured from the point where the javelin first touches the ground. 
          Success in the javelin throw requires a blend of technique, power, and timing to achieve maximum distance.

        <h5>EQUIPMENT USED</h5>
        <p>
          <b>Javelin:</b>A spear-like object made from metal or composite materials. It is about 2.5 meters long and weighs between 600 to 800 grams. 
                  The javelin is designed for aerodynamics and durability, with a pointed tip to facilitate a long and accurate throw.<br>
                   <b>Throwing Sector:</b>A marked area where the throw is made, typically shaped like a sector of a circle. It includes a runway for the athlete's approach and a marked landing area where the javelin must land.<br>
                   <b>Runway:</b>The designated area where athletes build up speed before releasing the javelin. It is usually about 30 meters long and 4 meters wide.<br>
                   <b>Landing Area:</b> The section of the throwing sector where the javelin must land for the throw to be valid. It is typically a 29.5-degree sector with a boundary line.

        <h5>JAVELIN GROUND</h5>
        <p>
          The javelin ground comprises a runway, throwing sector, and landing area. The runway, about 30 meters long and 4 meters wide, is where athletes gain speed before releasing the javelin.
                 The throwing sector is a 29.5-degree arc extending from the end of the runway where the javelin must land to be considered a valid throw. The landing area within this sector is marked to accurately measure the distance of each throw.
                 These elements ensure the event is conducted safely and measurements are precise.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY JAVELIN?</h5>
        <p>
          To play javelin, an athlete begins by positioning themselves at the start of the runway, a designated strip about 30 meters long. They run towards the end of the runway, gaining speed while holding the javelin, which is a spear-like object designed for aerodynamic flight.
             As they reach the end of the runway, they must use a specific technique to release the javelinâ€”this involves a powerful overhand throw combined with a precise release angle. The goal is to launch the javelin as far as possible into the throwing sector, which is a 29.5-degree arc. 
             The throw is considered valid if the javelin lands within this sector, and its distance is measured from the point where it first touches the ground. Successful javelin throwing requires a blend of speed, strength, and technique.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
          In javelin throw, points are not awarded; instead, performance is based on distance. Athletes are given a set number of attempts to throw the javelin as far as possible. 
          The distance is measured from the point where the javelin first touches the ground within the designated throwing sector. Each athlete's best valid throw is recorded, and the athlete with the farthest throw wins.

        <h5>INDIANS IN JAVELIN</h5>
        <p>
          Indian athletes have made notable contributions to javelin throw in recent years, with Neeraj Chopra standing out as a prominent figure. Chopra, a highly accomplished javelin thrower, gained international fame by winning gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, making him the first Indian to secure an Olympic gold in track and field. 
            He also earned gold medals at the 2018 Asian Games and the 2016 South Asian Games, and he holds several national records. Another emerging talent, Rohit Yadav, has demonstrated his potential with strong performances at regional events.
