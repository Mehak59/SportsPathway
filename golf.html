            Golf is a precision sport where players use a variety of clubs to hit a ball into a series 
            of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. The game is played on a vast,
             landscaped course with different types of terrain, including fairways, greens, and hazards.  </p>

        <h5>WHAT IS GOLF?</h5>
        <p>
            Golf, a cross-country game in which a player strikes a small ball with various clubs from a 
            series of starting points (teeing grounds) into a series of holes on a course. The player who 
            holes his ball in the fewest strokes wins. The origins of the game are difficult to ascertain, 
            although evidence now 
            suggests that early forms of golf were played in the Netherlands first and then in Scotland.

        <h5>GOLF COURSE</h5>
        <p>
            A golf ground, or golf course, is a landscaped area designed for the sport of golf. 
            It typically features 18 holes, each with a tee box, fairway, green, and various hazards 
            such as bunkers and water hazards. The layout is carefully designed to challenge players 
            with different terrains and obstacles. The course includes walking paths or cart paths for 
            players to move between holes. Overall, the golf ground provides a setting for 
            players to test their skills and enjoy the game in a natural, often picturesque environment.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY GOLF?</h5>
        <p>
            To play golf, you aim to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course using the fewest 
            number of strokes. Start by teeing off from the designated area and use a driver or iron 
            to strike the ball down the fairway toward the green. Once on the green, use a putter to 
            roll the ball into the hole. Each hole has a par, which is the number of strokes an expert 
            is expected to take to complete it. Success in golf requires skill, precision, 
            and strategic planning to navigate the course and overcome obstacles.</p>

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
            In golf, points are scored based on the number of strokes taken to complete each hole. 
            Each hole has a par value, representing the number of strokes an expert golfer is expected 
            to use. Scoring is straightforward: if you complete a hole in fewer strokes than par, you 
            score under par; if it takes more strokes, you score over par. The goal is to finish the 
            course with the fewest total strokes. 
            The player with the lowest total score relative to par wins the game.</p>

        <h5>RULES</h5>
          <p>The rules of golf are designed to ensure fairness and consistency throughout the game. 
            Players must hit the ball from its current position without moving it, except in certain 
            situations like taking a drop. If a ball goes out of bounds, players incur a penalty and 
            must re-hit from the original spot. Special rules apply when the ball lands in hazards, 
            such as bunkers or water, often requiring a penalty stroke and a specific method for proceeding. 
            The main objective is to complete the course with the fewest number of strokes, with 
            each hole having a par value that indicates the expected number of strokes for completion.
