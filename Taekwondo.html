          <h1>Explore<br />Taekwondo</h1>
          <p>
            Taekwondo is a martial art that originated in Korea. It is known for its dynamic and powerful kicking 
            techniques, as well as its focus on self-defense, discipline, and sportsmanship. Taekwondo practitioners 
            train to improve their physical fitness, coordination, and mental focus.
            <br>
            The art emphasizes the use of hands and feet to deliver strikes, blocks, and kicks. Taekwondo 
            competitions often feature sparring matches, where participants use controlled strikes to score points.

          <h5>WHAT IS TAEKWONDO?</h5>
          <p>
            Taekwondo is a Korean martial art and combat sport that combines punching and kicking techniques 
            with a focus on striking, kicking, and jumping. The word Taekwondo can be translated as tae 
            ("strike with foot"), kwon ("strike with hand"), and do ("the art or way").
            <br><br>
            In addition to its five tenets of courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control and indomitable spirit, 
            the sport requires three physical skills: poomsae (품새), kyorugi (겨루기) and gyeokpa (격파).

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY TAEKWONDO?</h5>
          <p>
            <b>Match Structure: </b>Each match consists of three rounds, each lasting 2 minutes.
            There is a 1-minute break between rounds. The match is won by the athlete with the most points at the end of 
            the three rounds.
            If both athletes are tied, a Golden Point Round (GPR) is fought. The first athlete to score in the GPR wins the match.
            <br><br>
            <b>Etiquette: </b>Competitors must bow to the judges and each other before and after the match.
            <br><br>
            <b>Prohibited Acts: </b>Attacking an opponent's face or below the waist. Using the knee or head to block or kick an 
            opponent. Holding or grabbing an opponent's uniform or equipment. Deliberately touching the floor with any part of the 
            body other than the sole of the foot.
            <br><br>
            <b>Penalties: </b>A gam-jeom is declared when an athlete commits a prohibited act. If an athlete accumulates 5 gam-jeoms 
            in a single round, their opponent is automatically declared the winner of that round. If an athlete accumulates 10 
            gam-jeoms throughout the match, they are disqualified.
